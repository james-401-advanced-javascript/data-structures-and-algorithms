# Challenge Info

## Code Challenge 06 - Linked List Insertion

- The point of this code challenge will be to add alternative insertion operations to a linked list.

### Challenge

- Write the following methods for the Linked List class:

  - .append(value) which adds a new node with the given value to the end of the list

  - .insertBefore(value, newVal) which add a new node with the given newValue immediately before the first value node
  - .insertAfter(value, newVal) which add a new node with the given newValue immediately after the first value node

### Approach & Efficiency

- For this challenge, I chose first to write comments explaining what the goals were for each function. I wanted to make the code as clean as possible, but still expressive. The logic was fairly straight-forward. As for the verification, I chose to run the toString() function, which outputs the entire Linked List, in order to get confirmation that the functions are working properly.

## API

- insert(string)

  - This function takes in a value. This function will then create a new Node object, and set the objectâ€™s data property equal to the value. The function then appends this new Node object to the beginning of the linked list (i.e. it sets a new head).

- insertBefore(string)

  - This function adds a Node before a specified Node in the list.

- insertAfter(string)

  - This function adds a Node after a specified Node in the list.

- append(string)

  - This functions adds a Node to the end of the list.

- includes(string)

  - This function takes in a value and returns a boolean if that value exists in the linked list.

- toString()
  - This function takes in no arguments and returns a string representing all the values in the linked list.
