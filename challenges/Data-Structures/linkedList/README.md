# Challenge Info

## Code Challenge 05 - Linked List

- The point of this code challenge is to create a linked list. The main objective is to get familiar with what a link list is, how it works internally, and how we can move from one item (or node) to the next within this data structure.

### Challenge

- Create a class named Node. This class should contain:
  A variable to hold data (i.e. this.data).
  A variable to hold the next Node object (i.e. this.next).
  Create a class named LinkedList. This class should contain:
  A variable named head which holds the Node object that starts the list.
  A constructor that instantiates head as an empty linked list.
  A function called insert which takes in a value and appends this value to the beginning of the linked list (i.e. it sets a new head).
  A function called includes which takes in a value and returns a boolean if that value exists in the linked list.
  A function called toString whcih takes in no arguments and returns a string representing all the values in the linked list.
  Implement good error checking throughout your code. Create custom errors that describe what went wrong.

### Approach & Efficiency

- For this challenge, I chose first to write comments explaining what the goals were for each function. I wanted to make the code as clean as possible, but still expressive. The logic was fairly straight-forward. As for the verification, I chose to have the functions return values and console.log the functions to verify their efficacy.

## API

- insert(string)

  - This function takes in a value. This function will then create a new Node object, and set the objectâ€™s data property equal to the value. The function then appends this new Node object to the beginning of the linked list (i.e. it sets a new head).

- includes(string)

  - This function takes in a value and returns a boolean if that value exists in the linked list.

- toString()
  - This function takes in no arguments and returns a string representing all the values in the linked list.
